README: Matrix Multiplication Library

This project provides a high-performance C shared library (libmatrix_operations.so) for matrix multiplication, optimized with GCC optimizations (-O3) and position-independent code (-fPIC).
ðŸš€ Building the Shared Library

Run the following command to compile:

make

This will generate libmatrix_operations.so.
ðŸ§¹ Cleaning Up

To remove the compiled library:

make clean

ðŸ”— Usage in .NET (P/Invoke)

In your C# code, reference the shared library:

[DllImport("libmatrix_operations.so", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public static extern void MultiplyMatrices(int n, double[] A, double[] B, double[] C);

ðŸ“Œ Running .NET Benchmark

Ensure the shared library is in your path:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)
dotnet run -c Release

Now you're ready to benchmark C vs. .NET SIMD performance! ðŸš€
